//! # Unsafe-Soundness-Boundary Family — stdlib antigens (beta.2 voyage)
//!
//! Soundness holes reachable from safe-looking code — the `unsafe`-primitive
//! call-shapes where a wrong invariant is **Undefined Behavior**, not a panic.
//! RUSTSEC's informational=unsound advisories + rustc's deny-by-default unsafe
//! lints (`mutable_transmutes`, `invalid_from_utf8_unchecked`) are the prior-art.
//!
//! Biology cognate: the **breached self/non-self membrane** — `unsafe` is the
//! explicit "I'm crossing the safety membrane, trust me." A wrong `unsafe`
//! invariant is a forged MHC marker (a foreign cell passing as self). This rhymes
//! hard with the Mucosal-Boundary family (trust-boundary) — it is mucosal-boundary
//! applied to the *memory-safety* membrane (the new-family-vs-deep-tier question
//! is a naturalist call; the members are the same either way).
//!
//! ## Antigen-category (ADR-028)
//!
//! `FunctionalCorrectness`: each `unsafe` primitive, used with a wrong invariant,
//! produces a wrong *effect* — Undefined Behavior (memory corruption, an invalid
//! value, a UB string), the soundness the safe/unsafe boundary exists to keep.
//!
//! ## Why these are NAMED call-tells (effective-codomain)
//!
//! Every needle is a **rare/std-specific** unsafe primitive (`transmute`,
//! `assume_init`, `from_utf8_unchecked`, …) — a domain type will not have a method
//! by that name, so the needle alone restricts the codomain to the defect
//! population (the self-anchor rule). The *presence* of the call is current-scanner;
//! the precise size/lifetime/validity check is the v0.4 semantic tier.
